# Variables and Types

```php
$x = 1;         // number value
$y = "foo";     // string value
$z = True;      // boolean value
```

This is the syntax to define variables.
You can use the variables only when they are defined.
There are many types of variables in PHP - the most basic ones are:
    - Integer (whole number)
    - Float (real number)
    - Strings
    - Booleans
    * Variables can also be set to NULL - the variable exists but does not contain a value.

```
$name = "Hogun";
echo "Your name is $name";      // prints out: Your name is Hogun
```
