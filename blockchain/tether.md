Tether is a cryptocurrency that aims to be a stable coin - a proxy between other cryptocurrencies and USD.

Tether is backed by USD - 1 Tether is pegged to 1 USD.
Although Tether claims that USD and Tether are 100% backed, there is no independent proof of 100% backing. 
In other words, there has not been any 3rd party auditing report on Tether.  
On top of that, there are conspiracies regarding their close link with Bitfinex, an exchange based in Hong Kong.
