# React Native 

This is a Github directory for all information about app development using React Native.
There may be variations resulting from different development and target OS.
My development and target OS are:

- Development OS: macOS

- Targeting OS: iOS

In this setting, you will need Node, Watchman, React-Native CLI, and Xcode. 

## Install Dependencies

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Create an Application

```
react-native init MyApp
cd MyApp
react-native run-ios
```
